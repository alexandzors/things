# This script automatically rolls back Hyper-V VMs to the most recent checkpoint if it is powered off. However you could probably change that.
# Recommend using this with Task Scheduler on a set schedule.
# This script could also use some error handling as be default it doesn't.

# NOTE THIS REVERTS ANY HYPER-V VM THAT IS TURNED OFF WHEN THIS SCRIPT RUNS!
