# THIS IS AN OLD SCRIPT. PLEASE SEE checkservices.ps1 FOR A NEWER SCRIPT.
# This can be used with task scheduler to automatically restart a service every few minutes if it shuts off. This does not auto detect the service status until it is run. 
# aka no watchdog
# Service name needs to be what is displayed in the service properties window. IT IS CASE SENSITIVE!
# Some services require Admin priviledges to start. So I recommend running this with " Run with highest privileges" checked in task scheduler.
